# Fiancé

You need to get your finances in order, but don't know where to start? Do not worry, as your Fiancé is here to help you.

## System requirements

It is currently unclear which hardware you will need.

It is, however, clear what you should have software-wise:
- Java 8 or later
  - Therefore, it could require one of the following systems
    - Windows Vista SP2, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.x, Windows 10 or Windows 11
    - Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 or later
    - Any Linux distribution which came out after 2012
  - Nicolas will primarily test it on an openSUSE Tumbleweed/Windows 11 system
- Developer tools
  - IntelliJ IDEA with the Swing UI Designer plugin
- [Xerial's SQLite library](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc)
